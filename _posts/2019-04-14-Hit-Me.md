title: Hit me

Here's the idea:

You ever sit around your place, wishing a friend was around to toss you a snack? Nibl is our solution. We want to design a robot candy turret that responds to the voice command "Hit me", performs an infrared scan of the room to locate you, and then fires a Skittle. This blog will follow our journey. We'll also build a companion app where you can Nibl wherever you want. Welcome!
